      <h2>Our Mission:</h2>
      <p>
        SEIZE Energy is all about delivering clean, bold, crash-free energy. No artificial sweeteners, just pure energy that delivers on its promise. We want everyone to feel great when drinking SEIZE, so we made sure to include ingredients that hydrate you, help your mental focus, as well as give you the energy you crave.
      </p>

      <h2>Why SEIZE:</h2>
      <p>
        We use clean ingredients such as real juice powder to help enhance our bold flavors, as well as clean energy. We use 150MG of caffeine anhydrous to give that energy you know and love but smooth it out with 50MG of caffeine dimalate. Were built for everyone, whether your going to the gym, waking up early, or even studying, we're here to get you through it all. Take control, SEIZE your energy!
